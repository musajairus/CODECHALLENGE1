# CODE CHALLENGE 1
**Tools Overview**
**1. Student Grade Generator :**
 This tool allows a user to input student marks (between 0 and 100) and returns the corresponding grade based on the following grading system:
A → greater than 79,
B → between 60 and 79,
C → between 49 and 59,
D → between 40 and 49, and
E → less than 40.
**The program validates inputs and ensures only numbers within the range are accepted. It’s useful for quickly classifying student performance.**


**2. Speed Detector:**
 This tool evaluates a driver’s speed against the legal speed limit (70 km/s):
If the speed is 70 or below, it simply prints "Ok".
For every 5 km/s above the limit, the driver receives 1 demerit point.
If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, their license is suspended.
**This program demonstrates how conditional logic can be used to enforce rules, similar to real-world traffic monitoring systems.**


**3. Net Salary Calculator:**
 This tool computes an employee’s Net Salary in Kenya (2025 rules) by considering all statutory deductions:
NSSF (6%) → Retirement contributions, capped at pensionable pay of 72,000.
SHIF (2.75%) → Social Health Insurance Fund, replacing NHIF.
Housing Levy (1.5%) → Mandatory contribution to affordable housing.
PAYE (progressive tax bands) → Income tax calculated in multiple brackets.
Personal Relief (Ksh 2,400) → Applied to reduce PAYE liability.
The tool outputs a full payslip breakdown, including:
Gross Salary
NSSF Contribution
SHIF Contribution
Housing Levy
PAYE Tax
Net Salary (final take-home pay)
**This is the most comprehensive tool, simulating a real-world payroll system that employers use to process monthly salaries.**
